Description: Provides a compact 'R' interface for performing tensor calculations.
    This is achieved by allowing (upper and lower) index labeling of arrays
    and making use of Ricci calculus conventions to implicitly trigger
    contractions and diagonal subsetting.
    Explicit tensor operations, such as addition, subtraction and
    multiplication of tensors via the standard operators, raising and lowering
    indices, taking symmetric or antisymmetric tensor parts, as well as the
    Kronecker product are available. Common tensors like the Kronecker delta
    Levi Civita epsilon, certain metric tensors, the Christoffel symbols,
    the Riemann as well as Ricci tensors are provided.
    The covariant derivative of tensor fields with respect to any metric
    tensor can be evaluated. An effort was made to provide the user with
    meaningful error messages.
